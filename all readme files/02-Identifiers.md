# Identifiers

So we will dive into, what are constants, keywords and variables

## Constants

- any info is constant
- data = info = constant

![Types of constants](/all%20readme%20files/images/types_of_constants.png)

- Primary(basic or fundamental constants)
  - Integer - whole numbers or integers
  - real - numbers with decimal points even if its 3.0
  - character - single quotes me likhe jaane wale, there is twist i.e. it should be only one character(eg. 'a' , '+' , '1' , 'A', ' ')('shubham' wouldn't be a character but a string)

## Variables

- variables are the names of memory locations where we store data.
- variable name is any combination of alphabet (a to z)(A to Z), digit(0 to 9) and underscore(\_)
- variable can't start with a digit.

## Keywords

- predefined words, these words are already known to the compiler.

## Data type

- int 2byte integer
- char byte character
- float 4byte real
- double 8byte real
- void

## declare variables anywhere

- unlike C, you can declare variables even after action statements.
