# Learning CPP

Notes are made from **Saurabh Shukla's C++ playlist**. Link toh the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLYz8uHU480j37APNXBdPz7YzAi4XlQUF).
the notes are made in Hinglish(hindi+enlish). notes are sometimes unreadable to me as well(i am still improving/developing it).

You can watch the videos, if you have any doubt in the given notes. The notes have clearly mentioned where they are taken from(topic name in the notes is same as topic name in the videos).

## How to read notes

- navigate to all ` readme files` there you can see topic name, read what you wanna read.
- the code written the markdown files are saved in the `All Programs` folder.
